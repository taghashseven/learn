## Contours in Image Processing

Contours are the boundaries of objects in an image, and they play a crucial role in object detection, shape analysis, and image segmentation. OpenCV provides functions to find and manipulate contours in images.

### Function Signature and Docstring:

```python
contours, hierarchy = cv2.findContours(image, mode, method[, contours[, hierarchy[, offset]]])
```

**Parameters:**
- `image`: Input binary image (8-bit single-channel image). The image should be thresholded or preprocessed to highlight the objects.
- `mode`: Contour retrieval mode. It specifies the retrieval hierarchy and how contours are retrieved.
- `method`: Contour approximation method. Specifies how much the contour should be approximated to save memory.
- `contours`: Output list where each contour is stored as a numpy array.
- `hierarchy`: Optional output hierarchy of contours. Useful for hierarchical structures in the image.
- `offset`: Optional offset by which the contours are shifted.

**Returns:**
- `contours`: List of contours present in the image.
- `hierarchy`: Hierarchical representation of the contours (parent-child relationships).

### Example Code:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load an image (make sure it's thresholded or preprocessed)
image = cv2.imread('object.jpg', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

# Find contours using the cv2.findContours function
contours, hierarchy = cv2.findContours(image, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

# Create a blank image to draw contours
contour_image = np.zeros_like(image)

# Draw contours on the blank image
cv2.drawContours(contour_image, contours, -1, (255), thickness=2)

# Display the original and contour images
cv2.imshow('Original Image', image)
cv2.imshow('Contour Image', contour_image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

**Explanation:**
1. Load an image (ensure it's preprocessed) and convert it to grayscale.
2. Use `cv2.findContours` to detect contours. The `RETR_EXTERNAL` mode retrieves only the external contours.
3. Create a blank image of the same size to draw contours on.
4. Use `cv2.drawContours` to draw the detected contours on the blank image.
5. Display the original image and the image with drawn contours.

### Analogy: Connecting Dots

Think of contours as connecting dots on a coloring book page. Imagine you have a page with different shapes outlined by dots. Finding contours is like tracing those dots with a pen to outline the shapes. The contours represent the boundaries of the shapes, and you can manipulate or analyze them as needed.

Contours are the building blocks of object analysis in images, helping you identify and work with the shapes present in the image.
